Plugins are basically 3rd party plugins which start executing when the user manually tells the plugin to run. Plugins are used to add more functionality to the workshop. These plugins can be used to enhance the developing experience for developers making games on Cubern and also help learn how internally the workshop works.
Plugins are sandboxed so they are safe to use. Even if the plugin attempts to add scripts, a permission popup will happen. Plugins are compulsory to be priced at 10 cubes minimum. But why? This is made to encourage users to buy cubes 
to support cubern and since 5 cubes are given daily by default: this allows users to buy plugins too without paying any physical money.
