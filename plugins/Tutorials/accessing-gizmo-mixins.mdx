Before we start, you may question yourself: what is a "gizmo"? In simple words a gizmo is a tool used for transform which looks like:

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/prev_gizmo.png"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/prev_gizmo.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

## Telling the workshop to select another selected object
To tell the workshop to select another keyword we can make use of `PluginServices` and request it.
```lua
PluginServices:SetSelected(Map["Cube"]) -- this will return nil if the object is not found.
```

To change gizmo modes for example to set it to rotation or scale or move we can use the `SetGizmoMode(int mode)`:
```lua
-- Currently enums are not used for this
PluginServices:SetGizmoMode(1) -- now the gizmo mode is "Move"
```
```lua
-- Currently enums are not used for this
PluginServices:SetGizmoMode(2) -- now the gizmo mode is "Scale"
```
Just like that you can use `GetGizmoMode` to get the current gizmo mode selected by the user.

## How shall I know if a object is selected?
You can get if already the user has selected an object with `GetSelected` which will return `nil` if no object was selected:
```lua
local object_selected = PluginServices:GetSelected()

if object_selected == nil then 
    PluginServices:SetSelected(Map["Cube"])
end
```
