Below is a list of errors you may run into while using cuberns clients (game-client, workshop-client, launcher-client and local-game-server-client)
This page is supposed to provide reasons and fixes for the errors you face.

## Game Client Errors
### - B33F
This error is resulted when a users client is unable to connect to the game-server and the client timesout. This can be caused by a late client-launch and the game-server shutted down itself assuming zero players. Or it can happen because of a error on server side. To resolve this issue you can try to relaunch from the website or report it on our discord server!
