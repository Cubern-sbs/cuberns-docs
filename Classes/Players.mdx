## Properties
#### `PlayerCount: int`
The `PlayerCount` holds a int value which has the total number of players in the game server

#### `RespawnTime: int`
The property holds a int value which is number of seconds to spawn player after players death. This is read only for client sided scripts and can be changed by server sided scripts.

## Functions
#### `GetPlayer(string username)`
`GetPlayer` will return a `Player` type. An example:
```lua
local Players = Game:GetService("Players")
local cubern_player = Players:GetPlayer("Cubern")
cubern_player:Kick("Yoink!")
-- Cubern currently doesnt support getting players like Players["Cubern"]
```
#### `GetLocalPlayer()`
Returns localPlayer as a `Player` type. This function can only be called by client-sided scripts. An example:
```lua
local Players = Game:GetService("Players")
local localPlayer = Players:GetLocalPlayer()
printl(localPlayer.username)
```

## Signals
#### `OnPlayerEntered`
The signal is called when a new player joins the game. This is valid on both: client sided and server sided scripts. An example:
```lua
local Players = Game:GetService("Players")
local ChatService = Game:GetService("ChatService")
Players:Connect("OnPlayerEntered", __SCRIPT__, "FunctionToCall")

function FunctionToCall(Player)
    ChatService:Push("Everybody! Welcome: " + Player.username);
end
```

#### `OnPlayerLeft`
The signal is called when a player leaves the game. This is valid on both: client sided and server sided scripts. An example:
```lua
local Players = Game:GetService("Players")
local ChatService = Game:GetService("ChatService")
Players:Connect("OnPlayerLeft", __SCRIPT__, "FunctionToCall")

end
