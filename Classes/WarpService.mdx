## Properties
#### `UseSafetySetup: bool`

## Functions
#### `Teleport(int gameid, Player player)`
The `Teleport` function teleports a player to a public server. If a server does not exist then one will be made. This only works for 1 player. An example:
```lua
local WarpService = Game:GetService("WarpService")
local Player_Cubern = Game:GetService("Players"):GetPlayer("Cubern")
if Player_Cubern ~= nil then 
    WarpService:Teleport(123, Player_Cubern)
end
```

#### `TeleportToPrivateServer(int gameid, Player player)`
The `TeleportToPrivateServer` function teleports a player to a private game server. This only works for a single 1 player. Meaning a solo private server would be made. An example:
```lua
local WarpService = Game:GetService("WarpService")
local Player_Cubern = Game:GetService("Players"):GetPlayer("Cubern")
if Player_Cubern ~= nil then 
    WarpService:TeleportToPrivateServer(123, Player_Cubern)
end
```

#### `TeleportGroupOfPlayersToPrivateServer(int gameid, Array players)`
The `TeleportGroupOfPlayersToPrivateServer` function teleports a group of players to a private game server. This will error if only a single player is present. An example:
```lua
local WarpService = Game:GetService("WarpService")
local Players = Game:GetService("Players")
local playersToTeleport = {
    Players:GetPlayer("Cubern"),
    Players:GetPlayer("Arexvy")
}
-- we do not need to worry if all players are nil or any however a soft warning will be produced
WarpService:TeleportGroupOfPlayersToPrivateServer(123, playersToTeleport)
```

## Signals
#### `OnWarpServiceFailure`
The `OnWarpServiceFailure` signal is emitted whenever teleportation service faces a failure. This wont be emitted whenever a internal error is faced by the game-server. An example:
```lua
local WarpService = Game:GetService("WarpService")
WarpService:Connect("OnWarpServiceFailure", __SCRIPT__, "ErrorFaced")
local Player_Cubern = Game:GetService("Players"):GetPlayer("Cubern")
WarpService:TeleportToPrivateServer(123, Player_Cubern)


function ErrorFaced(message) 
    printl(message) -- should output player is nil
end
```


#### `OnInternalError`
Called when game server throws a internal error. Example:
```lua
local WarpService = Game:GetService("WarpService")
local Player_Cubern = Game:GetService("Players"):GetPlayer("Cubern")
WarpService:TeleportToPrivateServer(123, Player_Cubern)
DataStoreService:Connect("OnInternalError", __SCRIPT__, "VpsFailure")

function VpsFailure(VPS_ERROR_RESPONSE_CODE, VPS_ERROR_ANY_DETAIL)
    -- this will automatically be forwarded to developers
    printl(VPS_ERROR_RESPONSE_CODE)
    printl(VPS_ERROR_ANY_DETAIL) 
end
```
