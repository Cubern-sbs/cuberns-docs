<Note>
  Cuberns `MeshPart` only support `.glb`. If you manage to import a `.gltf`: it won't work in playtest or exported build.

## Properties
#### `let_engine_make_collisions: bool`
Specifies if the engine should make collisions of mesh by itself. It has a significant impact on performance. This should only be used for structures which do not follow a single shape.

#### `mesh_id: int`
Specifies `mesh_id`. The value cannot be changed if any existing mesh is being loaded.

#### `play_anim_on_start: string`
The string value named animation will be played on start. 

#### `currently_running: string`
Returns name of animation currently running only if any else returns empty string. 

## Functions
#### `Play(string animationName)`
This function will play animation (if any found by name of `animationName` parameter). An example:
```lua
local meshPart = Map["AnimatedCube"]
meshPart:Play("Bounce");
```

#### `PlayBackwards(string animationName)`
This function will play animation backwards (if any found by name of `animationName` parameter). An example:
```lua
local meshPart = Map["AnimatedCube"]
meshPart:PlayBackwards("Bounce");
```

#### `StopAnimation()`
The function will stop a playing animation. An example:
```lua
local meshPart = Map["AnimatedCube"]
meshPart:PlayBackwards("Bounce");
wait(0.2)
meshPart:StopAnimation()
```

#### `GetAnimations()`
This function will return a list of name of animations inside the mesh. If none then returns nil. An example:
```lua
local meshPart = Map["AnimatedCube"]
local listOfAnims = meshPart:GetAnimations()
```
