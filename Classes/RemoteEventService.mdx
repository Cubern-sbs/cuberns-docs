## Functions
#### `PushToClient(string username, string eventName, ...)`
<Info>This function can only be called by the server.</Info>
This function is used to send data from server to client. You can send unlimited parameters after desired first 2 parameters. An example:
```lua
local RemoteEventService = Game:GetService("RemoteEventService")
local error = RemoteEventService:PushToClient("Cubern", "Event1", "hello!", Map.Cube, 22233)
if error == nil then
    printl("It is a success!")
else
    printl("It failed! The error is: " .. error)
end
```

#### `PushToAllClients(string eventName, ...)`
<Info>This function can only be called by the server.</Info>
This function is used to send data from server to all connected clients. You can send unlimited parameters after desired first parameter. An example:
```lua
local RemoteEventService = Game:GetService("RemoteEventService")
local error = RemoteEventService:PushToAllClients("Event1", "Starting minigame!")
if error == nil then
    printl("It is a success!")
else
    printl("It failed! The error is: " .. error)
end
```

#### `SendEventToServer(string eventName, ...)`
<Info>This function can only be called by the client.</Info>
This function is used by the client to send a event to the server. An example:
<CodeGroup>
```lua client.clua
local RemoteEventService = Game:GetService("RemoteEventService")
local error = RemoteEventService:SendEventToServer("Event1", "hello!", 222, Map.Cube)
if error == nil then
    printl("Sent!")
else 
    printl("Err!! " .. error)
end
```
```lua server.clua
local RemoteEventService = Game:GetService("RemoteEventService")
RemoteEventService:ConnectEvent("Event1", __SCRIPT__, "FunctionCall") -- since we had registered the event by name of "Event1" on client we will use "Event1" as first paramter
function FunctionToCall(data, username, statement_by_client, numberSent, cubeByClient)
    printl("Server recieved data from: " .. username)
    printl("Client says: " .. statement_by_client) -- outputs: Client says: hello!
    printl("Client gave number:" .. numberSent) -- outputs: Client gave number: 222
    printl("Cube type given by client: " .. cubeByClient.IsA()) -- outputs: Client type given by client: Par
end
```
</CodeGroup>

#### `ConnectEvent(string eventName, ...)`
<Info>This function can be called by both the client and the server.</Info>
This function is used to register a connection that when a event by the value of `eventName` is fired by the server or the client: the connected function will be called. An example:
```lua
local RemoteEventService = Game:GetService("RemoteEventService")
RemoteEventService:ConnectEvent("Event1", __SCRIPT__, "FunctionCall") -- since we had registered the event by name of "Event1" we will use "Event1" as first paramter
-- Same way can be used for the server
function FunctionToCall(data)
    printl(data.CastleName)
end
