## Functions
#### `PushToClient(string username, string eventName, Table data)`
<Info>This function can only be called by the server.</Info>
This function is used to send data from server to client. An example:
```lua
local RemoteEventService = Game:GetService("RemoteEventService")
local data = {
    CastleName = "Castley",
}
local error = RemoteEventService:PushToClient("Cubern", "Event1", data)
if error == nil then
    printl("It is a success!")
else
    printl("It failed! The error is: " .. error)
end
```

#### `PushToAllClients(string eventName, Table data)`
<Info>This function can only be called by the server.</Info>
This function is used to send data from server to all connected clients. An example:
```lua
local RemoteEventService = Game:GetService("RemoteEventService")
local data = {}
local error = RemoteEventService:PushToAllClients("Event1", data)
if error == nil then
    printl("It is a success!")
else
    printl("It failed! The error is: " .. error)
end
```

#### `SendEventToServer(string eventName, Table data)`
<Info>This function can only be called by the client.</Info>
This function is used by the client to send a event to the server. An example:
<CodeGroup>
```lua client.clua
local RemoteEventService = Game:GetService("RemoteEventService")
local data = {}
local error = RemoteEventService:SendEventToServer("Event1", data)
if error == nil then
    printl("Sent!")
else 
    printl("Err!! " .. error)
end
```
```lua server.clua
local RemoteEventService = Game:GetService("RemoteEventService")
RemoteEventService:ConnectEvent("Event1", __SCRIPT__, "FunctionCall") -- since we had registered the event by name of "Event1" on client we will use "Event1" as first paramter
function FunctionToCall(data, username)
    printl("Server recieved data from: " .. username)
end
```
</CodeGroup>

#### `ConnectEvent(string eventName, Table data)`
<Info>This function can be called by both the client and the server.</Info>
This function is used to register a connection that when a event by the value of `eventName` is fired by the server or the client: the connected function will be called. An example:
```lua
local RemoteEventService = Game:GetService("RemoteEventService")
RemoteEventService:ConnectEvent("Event1", __SCRIPT__, "FunctionCall") -- since we had registered the event by name of "Event1" we will use "Event1" as first paramter
-- Same way can be used for the server
function FunctionToCall(data)
    printl(data.CastleName)
end
```
