<Warning>Cubern doesnt currently support ability to connect signals through the workshop hence you need to connect through clua</Warning>
<Info>It is planned to allow several signal connections with 1 signal</Info>

Signals are used to automatically call a `@signal` function whenever something happens. For example the `OnMouseEntered` signal which is called whenever a mouse pointer enters the object. An example:
```lua
Map["Cube"]:Connect("OnMouseEntered", __SCRIPT__, "FunctionToCall")

@signal FunctionToCall()
    printl("Mouse entered!")
end
```

### Why do I need to use `@signal` instead of `function`? 
Well the reason is to have prettier code or code which is more understanding and readable.
