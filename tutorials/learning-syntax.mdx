In this tutorial we will be covering basics of the language and its syntax for-example about if statements or loops or variables.

## Diving into the syntax
### Variables
Variables are used like containers which store a value. These variables can be set and also be read in the [source-code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code).
There are 2 ways to define variables in clua. First we can make use of the keyword `local` which tells the [interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)) to create a variable which is then followed by the name of the variable with:
```lua
local MyVariable = 2
```
The `MyVariable` is the name for the variable. The `=` tells to set this as the value which is followed by the value (which is 2 in this example). Now a variable known as `MyVariable` has been declared which holds the value of 2.
Now this variable can have the value its holding set to something different. So lets go and make `MyVariable` hold a string sentence:
```lua
MyVariable = "Wow! I just love programming <3"
```
We can also declare variables without the use of `local`. Like:
```lua
MyVariable = "Yay!"
```
Now what clua will do here is that it will check if `MyVariable` exists then it will try to update its value to "Yay!" and if it doesnt exist then it will create a newer variable called `MyVariable` which will hold the value `Yay!`.

---
Now, lets dig into "constants" or `const`. This is a keyword in clua which tells the interpreter that once its value is set, no-one can change it. Like:
```go
const myName = "Arexvy"
```
Now if we try to change its value with:
```go
myName = "Cubern"
```
the interpreter would straight up deny since it was told to not **allow anyone else to change the value this variable holds** and this will just end up erroring and not let the script run.

### Learning about comments

Comments in Clua are lines of text in your code that the interpreter ignores during execution. They are useful for adding explanations, notes, or temporarily disabling parts of your code. Clua supports both single-line and multi-line comments.

#### Single-Line Comments

To create a single-line comment, you use two hyphens (`--`). Everything following the `--` on that line will be treated as a comment:

```lua
-- This is a single-line comment in Clua
local MyVariable = 10  -- You can also add comments at the end of a line
```

In the example above, the comment `-- This is a single-line comment in Clua` is ignored by the interpreter. The line `local MyVariable = 10` is executed normally, and the comment following it is ignored.

#### Multi-Line Comments

For comments that span multiple lines, Clua allows the use of `--[[` to open the comment and `]]` to close it. Everything between these markers is treated as a comment:

```lua
--[[
This is a multi-line comment.
You can write anything here,
and it will be ignored by the interpreter.
]]

local MyVariable = 10  -- This code will run normally
```

Multi-line comments are particularly useful for temporarily disabling large blocks of code or for adding detailed explanations.

Comments are a powerful tool for making your Clua code more understandable and maintainable. By using comments, you can explain your logic, leave notes for yourself or others, and manage your code more effectively.
### If statements
In Clua, the `if` statement is used to execute a block of code based on a condition. The basic syntax of an `if` statement is:

```lua
if <condition> then
    -- code to execute if the condition is true
end
```

#### Example 1: Basic If Statement

```lua
local number = 10

if number > 5 then
    printl("Number is greater than 5")
end
```

In this example, since `number` is 10, the condition `number > 5` is true, so the message "Number is greater than 5" will be printed.

#### Example 2: If-Else Statement

```lua
local number = 3

if number > 5 then
    printl("Number is greater than 5")
else
    printl("Number is 5 or less")
end
```

Here, the condition `number > 5` is false, so the code in the `else` block is executed, printing "Number is 5 or less".

#### Example 3: If-ElseIf-Else Statement

```lua
local number = 7

if number > 10 then
    printl("Number is greater than 10")
elseif number > 5 then
    printl("Number is greater than 5 but 10 or less")
else
    printl("Number is 5 or less")
end
```

In this case, the condition `number > 10` is false, so the `elseif` condition `number > 5` is checked. Since it's true, "Number is greater than 5 but 10 or less" is printed.

#### Nesting If Statements

Clua also allows you to nest `if` statements for more complex conditions:

```lua
local number = 8

if number > 5 then
    if number < 10 then
        printl("Number is between 6 and 9")
    end
end
```

Here, the outer `if` checks if `number` is greater than 5. Since it's true, the nested `if` checks if `number` is less than 10. Both conditions are true, so "Number is between 6 and 9" is printed.

This section introduces the concept of `if` statements, explains the syntax, and provides examples to illustrate how they work in Clua.

### Loops 
Loops in Clua allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. They are useful for tasks that require repetition, such as iterating over a collection or performing an action a set number of times. Clua supports `for`, `while`, and `repeat-until` loops.

#### For Loops
<Info>`For loops support continue to skip iteration. </Info>
A `for` loop is commonly used when you know in advance how many times you want to execute a block of code.
##### Example 1: Basic For Loop

```lua
for i = 1, 5 do
    printl("Iteration: " .. i)
end
```

This loop runs 5 times, printing "Iteration: 1" to "Iteration: 5".

##### Example 2: For Loop with Step

```lua
for i = 10, 1, -2 do
    printl("Countdown: " .. i)
end
```

This loop counts down from 10 to 2 in steps of 2, printing "Countdown: 10", "Countdown: 8", etc.

#### While Loops

A `while` loop repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. The basic syntax is:

```lua
while condition do
    -- code to execute repeatedly
end
```

##### Example: Basic While Loop

```lua
local i = 1

while i <= 5 do
    printl("While Loop Iteration: " .. i)
    i = i + 1
end
```

In this example, the loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to 5, printing "While Loop Iteration: 1" to "While Loop Iteration: 5".

#### Repeat-Until Loops

A `repeat-until` loop is similar to a `while` loop but with a key difference: it checks the condition after the loop body has executed. This means the loop always runs at least once. The syntax is:

```lua
repeat
    -- code to execute repeatedly
until condition
```

##### Example: Basic Repeat-Until Loop

```lua
local i = 1

repeat
    printl("Repeat-Until Loop Iteration: " .. i)
    i = i + 1
until i > 5
```

In this example, the loop runs until `i` is greater than 5, printing "Repeat-Until Loop Iteration: 1" to "Repeat-Until Loop Iteration: 5".

Loops are essential for performing repetitive tasks in Clua. By using `for`, `while`, and `repeat-until` loops, you can create efficient, readable code that handles a variety of repetitive tasks.

## Diving into common ways of doing
#### Accessing objects with clua
It is very easy to acces objects in clua. Like:
```lua
local Cube = Map.Cube
```
We can refer `Map` and then use a dot followed by the name of the part. This would either return `nil` or the object. And then we can process it:
```lua
local Cube = Map.Cube
if Cube != nil then 
    printl(Cube.name)
end
```
