In this tutorial we will be covering basics of the language and its syntax for-example about if statements or loops or variables.

## Diving into the syntax
### Variables
Variables are used like containers which store a value. These variables can be set and also be read in the [source-code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code).
There are 2 ways to define variables in clua. First we can make use of the keyword `local` which tells the [interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)) to create a variable which is then followed by the name of the variable with:
```lua
local MyVariable = 2
```
The `MyVariable` is the name for the variable. The `=` tells to set this as the value which is followed by the value (which is 2 in this example). Now a variable known as `MyVariable` has been declared which holds the value of 2.
Now this variable can have the value its holding set to something different. So lets go and make `MyVariable` hold a string sentence:
```lua
MyVariable = "Wow! I just love programming <3"
```
We can also declare variables without the use of `local`. Like:
```lua
MyVariable = "Yay!"
```
Now what clua will do here is that it will check if `MyVariable` exists then it will try to update its value to "Yay!" and if it doesnt exist then it will create a newer variable called `MyVariable` which will hold the value `Yay!`.

Now, lets dig into "constants" or `const`. This is a keyword in clua which tells the interpreter that once its value is set, no-one can change it. Like:
```go
const myName = "Arexvy"
```
Now if we try to change its value with:
```go
myName = "Cubern"
```
the interpreter would straight up deny since it was told to not **allow anyone else to change the value this variable holds** and this will just end up erroring and not let the script run.

### Booleans
We can imagine booleans same as "yes" or "no". But rather then "yes" or "no" its "true" or "false".

### If statements

### Loops 

### Functions

### Signals

### Common functions

### Global variables
