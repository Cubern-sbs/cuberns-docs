## Getting Started
To get started. For this tutorial we need a glb mesh which has the character. You can convert from `.obj` -> `.glb` with blender or export your model from blender as `.glb`. We then make use of workshops mesh importer plugin and then move the imported `MeshPart` to `ClientStorage`.

## Telling cubern about the character
For us to tell cubern about our custom character controller we will create a new local script (or you can make use of a existing local script). Lets go onto this 
step by step. First let us access the character:
```lua
local ClientStorage = Game:GetService("ClientStorage")
local CustomCharacter = ClientStorage["CustomCharacter"] -- whatever you have named your character
```
After we have declared our custom character as a variable we can go and register this character to tell cubern to use custom character instead of cuberns classic character.
```lua
local ClientStorage = Game:GetService("ClientStorage")
local CustomCharacter = ClientStorage["CustomCharacter"] -- whatever you have named your character
Game:GetService("Players"):SetDefaultCharacter(CustomCharacter)
```
The `SetDefaultCharacter` function will only take a `MeshPart` class. If you have made a character inside cuberns workshop then you can export it as a `.glb` and import it. And now we have 
successfully registered our default character! **Keep in mind that the user will not spawn until the mesh does not get cached onto their client.**

## Talking about Animations
Cuberns workshop currently does not offer a built-in animation editor. So, you can make use of 3D software like blender and make some animations. Once you have made animations make sure you export them with your `.glb` file! 
By default cubern will try to access animations named: `Walk`, `Jump` and `Idle`. However if your models animations are named differently. You can:
```lua
local Players = Game:GetService("Players")
Players:SetDefaultCharacterAnimations("Walk1", "Jump1", "Idle45") 
```
and now cubern will try to access `MeshPart`s `Walk1` animation and use that instead of `Walk`. 

### What if my MeshPart doesnt have any animation?
If your MeshPart or custom character does not have animations then no animations will be used.
