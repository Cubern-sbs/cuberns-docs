With using static-typing, clua can detect more errors and too in-depth without the need to running the code. 

Overall, typed programming gives you a more structured experience. It helps prevent errors and improves the self-documenting aspect of your scripts. This is especially helpful when you're working in a team or on a long-term project: studies have shown that developers spend most of their time reading other people's code, or scripts they wrote in the past and forgot about. The clearer and the more structured the code, the faster it is to understand, the faster you can move forward.

## Using static-typing in clua
To define the type of a variable, parameter, or constant, write a colon after the name, followed by its type. For example, `local Health: int = 100`. This forces the variable to hold the value of same type **only**:
```lua
local Health: int = 100

Health = "String"
```
This will error: "Expected int got string" and the script execution will stop.

We can also use cuberns native objects like `Part` as demonstrated below:
```lua
local Cube: Part = Map.Cube
```
\
Functions also do support static-typing with their parameters. An example shows:
```lua
function StaticTypedFunction(whatToPrint: string)
    return whatToPrint;
end

printl(StaticTypedFunction("Hello, World!"))
```

\
Clua now also supports `Table` for example:
```lua
function StaticTypedFunction(myTable : Table) -> Table 
    return myTable
end
```
## Specify the return type of a function with the arrow `->`
To define the return type of a function, write a dash and a right angle bracket -> after its declaration, followed by the return type:
```lua
function getCube() -> Part
    return Map.Cube
end

printl(getCube().name)
```
## Making variables or function parameters nill-able
By default if we make use of:
```lua
local myvariable: string = "haha!"
```
we cannot assign it `nil` and it will cause a script-runtime error exception stopping the execution of the clua script. However, if we add the `?` (question-mark) right next to the data-type: this will tell the interpreter to accept a nil-value as well. For example:
```lua
local myvariable : string? = nil -- this will not error!
myvariable = "haha!" -- this will not error!
myvariable = 22 -- this will error!
```

## Specify the element type of an Table
Currently clua does not support specifying type for a table. However, it is planned:
```lua
local MyTable: [int] = { 2, 3, 4 }
```

## The main question: Typed or dynamic?
Typed clua and dynamic clua all can co-exist in a same project/game. However, it is recommended to stick with a single style so it looks better and is very easier to read.
Typed code requires a little bit of more writing which can be tiring. Tho we recommend writing dynamic clua since typed clua is still in early stages of development.
