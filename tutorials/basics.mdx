In this tutorial we will be covering basics of clua so you could understand differences and how it all works.
## Common functions
#### Debugging
In other languages printing is commonly done with `print`. However, clua instead uses `printl` to write into the console/output and 
for debugging. Users can use other functions like `warnl` or `errl` to produce custom made errors and warnings.

#### Stopping a clua script for sometime
In programming, you can pause execution for sometime. It can be daunting in some languages since execution is done on threads and putting a thread to sleep which is the
main thread will cause the program to freeze. In clua you dont have to worry about such things since clua runs each of its script on a separate thread allowing users to use a `wait` function to
pause a script for sometime. A great example can be:
```lua script.clua
printl("Hello World!")
wait(5)
printl("This will be printed after 5 seconds!")
```

#### Syntax
Since clua extends lua, clua has the same syntax as lua! If you are not aware of the syntax of lua: not to worry! Check out the other tutorial to understand the syntax of lua!

#### Accessing objects inside `Game>Map`
In clua, accessing objects from `Map` is very straight-forward. For example a cube exists inside `Map` named `Cube1`. In-order to access it we will use:
```lua script.clua
local cube1 = Map["Cube1"]
```
Now we can access that cubes attributes or change them:
```lua script.clua
local cube1 = Map["Cube1"]
printl(cube1.name)
```
