In this tutorial we will be covering basics of clua so you could understand differences and how it all works.
## Common functions
#### Debugging
In other languages printing is commonly done with `print`. However, clua instead uses `printl` to write into the console/output and 
for debugging. Users can use other functions like `warnl` or `errl` to produce custom made errors and warnings.

#### Stopping a clua script for sometime
In programming, you can pause execution for sometime. It can be daunting in some languages since execution is done on threads and putting a thread to sleep which is the
main thread will cause the program to freeze. In clua you dont have to worry about such things since clua runs each of its script on a separate thread allowing users to use a `wait` function to
pause a script for sometime. A great example can be:
```lua script.clua
printl("Hello World!")
wait(5)
printl("This will be printed after 5 seconds!")
```

#### Syntax
Since clua extends lua, clua has the same syntax as lua! If you are not aware of the syntax of lua: not to worry! Check out the other tutorial to understand the syntax of lua!

#### Functions called by workshop
Since cubern and clua use `Godot 4.2`, we thought like gdscript why not introduce functions like `Process`, `PhysicsProcess`? They work in the same manner as gdscript `_process` etc work. 
The `Process` function is called automatically on every frame and takes a parameter of `delta` which is a `float`! Here's an example:
```lua process.clua
function Process(delta) 
    printl("This is called on every frame!!")
end
```
The `PhysicsProcess` function is also called automatically on every physics process and takes a parameter of `delta` and works the same way as `Process`
```lua phsyicsprocess.clua
function PhysicsProcess(delta) 
    printl("This is called on every physics frame!")
end
```
