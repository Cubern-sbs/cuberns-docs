## What is Clua?
Clua is a high level programming language which is built on-top of MoonSharp.

## Is this worth learning?
Learning clua in our opinion is very good to start with even if you are newer to programming, you can learn the basics of a programming language and play around. Other games like Roblox also use lua which is VERY identical to clua. 

## How is clua processed?
Clua is firstly compiled to bytecode. Then it is interpreted by the interpreter written in C#.

## Where do I learn the basics of the language?
You can read our "learning syntax" tutorial which goes in depth and explains basics.

## I've found a bug!
