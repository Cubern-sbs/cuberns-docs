## What is Clua?
Clua is a programming language which extends lua to make it eligible for cuberns workshop. The workshop is written in `Godot 4.2` with C#. The workshop is compiled Ahead-Of-Time so users can experience a much smoother performance. 

## Is this worth learning?
Learning clua in our opinion is very good to start with even if you are newer to programming, you can learn the basics of a programming language and play around. Other websites like Roblox also use a lua and clua's functions with robloxs lua are very similar!

## Is Clua Interpreted?
Yes! Clua is an interpreted language.

## How does the cubern workshop work?
We are actively working on documenting how the entire workshop works and release it to the public in a separate section in this documentation. But why? We love feedback / suggestions and even criticism! 

## I've found a bug!
If you've find a bug please immediately reach out to us via our discord server.
