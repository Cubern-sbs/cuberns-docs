Clua is basically lua but with little more features. In this tutorial we will go over the differences. Clua uses moonsharp but with improvements and changes.

## Getters and Setters
Lua does not have support for getters or setters by default. In clua you will find support for getters and setters. 

### Getters
Getters can be defined by `get` in clua. An exampel:
```lua
local myName = "Cubern"

get GetmyName()
    printl("Someone requested my name! Lets just say am Mr. Nobody!")
    return "My. Nobody"
end
if myName != "Cubern" then
    printl("That is not cubern!")
end
```
This block of code will print "That is not cubern!" because a get was defined for `myName` and cluas interpreter called it and got its return value. But what if the get returns nothing? 
```lua
local myName = "Cubern"

get GetmyName()
    printl("Someone requested my name!")
end

if myName != "Cubern" then
    printl("That is not cubern!")
else
    printl("Woah its cubern!") 
end
```
This block of code will print "Woah its cubern!" since cluas interpreter directly got the value assigned and ignored the void value the get returned.

### Setters 
Setters can be defined by `set` in clua. An example:
```lua
local myName = "Cubern"

set SetmyName(value)
    printl("Someone is changing my name!")
    myName = value
    printl("My name now is: " .. myName)
end

if myName == "Cubern" then
    printl("I dont like dat name!!")
    myName = "Cubarb"
end
```
This block of code will print "My name now is: Cubarb".


## Constants
Lua does not have `const` keyword. A `const` prevents the value from being overwritten or changed. An example can be:
```lua
const MyName = "Arexvy." -- this constant variable cannot also be changed by other scripts
MyName = "Arexvyy" -- this will error: "Cannot change a value of a constant variable."
```

<Info>Constants being used wrong will throw a error when being compiled to bytecode!</Info>
For example:
```lua
const duck = 2

function neverCalledFunction()
    duck = 3
end
```
This will generate a error even though that function is never called!

## Reserved functions
Clua has "reserved" functions. This keyword basically tells the interpreter that this function is probably/going to be called by the engine. An example:
```lua
reserved function PhysicsProcess(delta)
    -- this will be called automatically on every physic frame
end

function PhysicsProcess(delta)
    -- this will not be called automatically on every physic frame since it is not a reserved function
end
```
> Reserved functions are only supported with functions which would be called by the engine.

## `@doc`
The `@doc` keyword can be used for documenting.
Like:
```lua
@doc "This function will add"
function add(a, b)
    return a + b
end
```

The statement can also be without the double quotes:
```lua
@doc This function will add
function add(a, b)
    return a + b
end
```
since the interpreter for-now treats it just like a comment!

## istr
The `istr` keyword basically registers a immutable string variable. This also means that it only supports holding of a string type! 
An example:
```lua
istr mySentence = "So I was watching a"
mySentence = mySentence .. "movie." -- this will error: "Attempt to modify an immutable string"
```

## switch
The `switch` keyword basically generates a switch case pattern. An example:
```lua
local MyVariable = 0
switch(MyVariable) {
    case(0) (function()
        printl("The value is indeed zero.")
    end),
    default(function()
        printl("The value is not zero.")
    end)
}
```
> Please know that the switch case is just a clua written module and the interpreter does not have a switch functionality. This restricts creating functions like: `init` or `compare`.
