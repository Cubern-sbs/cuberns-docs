Clua is basically lua but with little more features. In this tutorial we will go over the differences. Clua uses moonsharp but with improvements and changes.

## Constants (added)
Lua does not have `const` keyword. A `const` prevents the value from being overwritten or changed. An example can be:
```lua
const MyName = "Arexvy." -- this constant variable cannot also be changed by other scripts
MyName = "Arexvyy" -- this will error: "Cannot change a value of a constant variable."
```

## Reserved functions (added)
Clua has "reserved" functions. This keyword basically tells the interpreter that this function is probably/going to be called by the engine. An example:
```lua
reserved function PhysicsProcess(delta)
    -- this will be called automatically on every physic frame
end

function PhysicsProcess(delta)
    -- this will not be called automatically on every physic frame since it is not a reserved function
end
```
> Reserved functions are only supported with functions which would be called by the engine.

## `@doc` (added)
The `@doc` keyword can be used for documenting.
Like:
```lua
@doc "This function will add"
function add(a, b)
    return a + b
end
```

The statement can also be without the double quotes:
```lua
@doc This function will add
function add(a, b)
    return a + b
end
```
since the interpreter for-now treats it just like a comment!

## istr (planned)
The `istr` keyword basically registers a immutable string variable. This also means that it only supports holding of a string type! 
An example:
```lua
istr mySentence = "So I was watching a"
mySentence = mySentence .. "movie." -- this will error: "Attempt to modify an immutable string"
```

## switch (planned)
The `switch` keyword basically generates a switch case pattern. An example:
```lua
local value = 2
switch value do
    case 1:
        printl("One")
        break
    case 2:
        printl("Two")
        break
    default:
        printl("Other")
end
```
