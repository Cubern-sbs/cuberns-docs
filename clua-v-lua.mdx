Clua is basically lua but with little more features. In this tutorial we will go over the differences. Clua uses moonsharp but with improvements and changes.

## Namespaces (planned)
Unlike lua, clua has namespaces. A namespace provides a container to hold things like functions, classes and constants as a way to group them together logically. Here is an example of declaring a namespace:
```lua script1.clua
namespace MyNameSpace {
    function SayHi() 
        printl("Hi!")
    end
}
-- it is not planned to add support for using dots (.) in namespace names
```

And in another script:
```lua script2.clua
using MyNameSpace

SayHi()
```

## Constants (added)
Lua does not have `const` keyword. A `const` prevents the value from being overwritten or changed. An example can be:
```lua
const MyName = "Arexvy." -- this constant variable cannot also be changed by other scripts
MyName = "Arexvyy" -- this will error: "Cannot change a value of a constant variable."
```

## Reserved functions (added)
Clua has "reserved" functions. This keyword basically tells the interpreter that this function is probably/going to be called by the engine. An example:
```lua
reserved function PhysicsProcess(delta)
    -- this will be called automatically on every physic frame
end

function PhysicsProcess(delta)
    -- this will not be called automatically on every physic frame since it is not a reserved function
end
```
> Reserved functions are only supported with functions which would be called by the engine.

## Getters and Setters (In-progress)
Lua does not offer getters or setters for variables. But, clua does!

#### Getters
Getters are automatically called whenever a variable is accessed at any line of the code. For example:
```lua
local Cubes = 2

get Cubes()
    printl("Attempted to access cubes variable!")
    return Cubes
end

print(Cubes) -- this will also cause the getter function to be called automatically! So "Attempted to access cubes variable!" will be printed too!
```

#### Setters 
Setters are automatically called whenever a attempt is made to write a newer value to a variable.
```lua
local Cubes = 2

set Cubes(value)
    printl("Attempted to set cubes value to" .. value)
    Cubes = value
end

Cubes = 4 -- triggers it
```

## `@doc` (added)
The `@doc` keyword can be used for documenting.
Like:
```lua
@doc "This function will add"
function add(a, b)
    return a + b
end
```

The statement can also be without the double quotes:
```lua
@doc This function will add
function add(a, b)
    return a + b
end
```
since the interpreter for-now treats it just like a comment!

## istr (planned)
The `istr` keyword basically registers a immutable string variable. This also means that it only supports holding of a string type! 
An example:
```lua
istr mySentence = "So I was watching a"
mySentence = mySentence .. "movie." -- this will error: "Attempt to modify an immutable string"
```

## switch (planned)
The `switch` keyword basically generates a switch case pattern. An example:
```lua
local value = 2
switch value do
    case 1:
        printl("One")
        break
    case 2:
        printl("Two")
        break
    default:
        printl("Other")
end
```
